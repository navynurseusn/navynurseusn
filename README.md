- 👋 Hi, I’m @navynurseusn
- 👀 I’m interested in retired Naval Officer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning I am working to learn more code applications and automation using SharePoint Online, Teams and all the adjacent apps. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to assign a SharePoint site its own responsive hit counter on a secured network. I am also hoping to find a solution of automatically changing the lead photograph on a SharePoint page where it changes every day. (Like a photo of the day concept)
